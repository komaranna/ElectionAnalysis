# ElectionAnalysis

Analyzing data from 2014 Hungarian National Elections:

1. DownloadData.ipynb: Script to download html files from public websites, requires minor interaction.

2. ExtractData.ipynb: Extracting key data from individual text files & saving it to a csv file (resulting csv file included: electoral.csv).

3. VisualizeData.ipynb: Doing sanity checks and initial analysis. Found minor signs of fraud in a few individual districts.

4. In-depth statistical analysis is underway, come back in a few weeks...
