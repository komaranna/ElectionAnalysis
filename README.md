# ElectionAnalysis

Analyzing data from 2014 Hungarian National Elections:

1. DownloadData.ipynb: Script to download html files from public websites, requires minor interaction.

2. ExtractData.ipynb: Extracting key data from individual text files & saving it to a csv file (resulting csv file included: electoral.csv).

3. VisualizeData.ipynb: Doing sanity checks and initial analysis. Found minor signs of fraud in a few individual districts.

4. StatisticalAnalysis (in progress): 

A. Checking independence of voter turnout and percentage of votes for certain parties: textbook-Gaussian for FIDESZ (winning party); minor elongation effects for rest of the parties, likely due to positive correlation between voter turnout and popularity of MSZP and LMP in urban areas

B. other statistical measures underway, check back in a few weeks...
